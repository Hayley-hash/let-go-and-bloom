    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Hayley and I would like to share a few things about me.

I have always been different and self motivated. I have often done exactly the opposite of everyone else and found myself going in the opposite direction.

As a child I was bullied, wore glasses and braces and didn’t do very well in school until my later years. Things got a little easier in High School and I put all my time and energy into sport, namely squash.

When I left school, I had a bright future ahead of me. I started university to study bachelor of business administration, majoring in Human Resources, only to drop out at the end of my second year.

An obsession for financial freedom and a happier, healthier life, has inspired me to change. Adding value to people came from my interest in human behavior and my experience in motivating staff members beneath me. This in turn has inspired this blog. As my new journey begins, I want to share and inspire other people to do the same.

The greatest thing in life is that yesterday doesn’t define us, WE have the power to change and reinvent ourselves for the better. Our book is empty, don’t let anyone else write your story. You are responsible for your own life. I believe everyone has the power to change and be brilliant. Start the journey with me!</p>
