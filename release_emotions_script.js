      "Fear": {
        what: "Fear shows up when we feel unsafe or threatened, even if the danger is imagined.",
        body: "Fear activates our fight-or-flight system, often causing physical tension and emotional paralysis.",
        why: "You are safe now. You don‚Äôt need to carry fear any longer. Let it leave your body with your breath."
      },
      "Shame": {
        what: "Shame makes us feel we are not good enough or worthy of love.",
        body: "It can lead to avoidance, hiding, and isolation. Your worth is not up for debate.",
        why: "You are allowed to release shame. It no longer serves your growth."
      },
      "Guilt": {
        what: "Guilt tells us we did something wrong. But healing begins when we forgive ourselves.",
        body: "It weighs heavy on the heart and can trap us in the past.",
        why: "Let guilt go. You‚Äôve done your best with the awareness you had."

      "Grief": {
        what: "Grief is love with nowhere to go. It‚Äôs natural and worthy of compassion.",
        body: "Grief sits in the chest and throat, often bringing tears and longing.",
        why: "Let grief move through you. Holding it tightly doesn‚Äôt bring them back."
      },
      "Sadness": {
        what: "Sadness is the soul's way of asking for tenderness.",
        body: "It slows us down, invites introspection, and makes us feel heavy.",
        why: "Let sadness pass like a cloud. Joy is still within reach."
      },
      "Anger": {
        what: "Anger is often a boundary trying to speak. It‚Äôs powerful but needs release.",
        body: "It creates pressure, heat, and a desire to act out.",
        why: "You don‚Äôt need to hold it anymore. Let it melt away in stillness."
